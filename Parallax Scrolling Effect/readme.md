This Parallax Scrolling effect is designed solely using GreenSock Animation Platform, GSAP which is a javascript library for designing animations at frontend. 5 layers of images
are present which are timelined using gsap and ensured smooth scrolling using scrub. The pin property of page1 is made true to ensure once animation finishes you scroll 
down.
